Introduction
------------

The Flag module allows you to define a boolean toggle field and attach it to a
node, comment, user, or any entity type. You may define as many of these 'flags'
as your site requires. By default, flags are per-user. This means any user with
the proper permission may chose to flag the entity.

One example use of Flag is to create a "read later" flag for content. Each user
may choose to mark the content as "read later". The site builder can create a
view that displays all the content the user has chosen to read later.

Other flag examples include:
 * Favorite
 * Mark as spam
 * Friend (for users)
