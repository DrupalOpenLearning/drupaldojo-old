REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES
----------------------

Drupal requires:

- A web server with PHP support, for example:
  - Apache 2.0 (or greater) (http://httpd.apache.org/).
  - Nginx 1.1 (or greater) (http://nginx.com/).
- PHP 5.5.9 (or greater) (http://php.net/). For better security support it is
  recommended to update to at least 5.5.21 or 5.6.5.
- One of the following databases:
  - MySQL 5.5.3 (or greater) (http://www.mysql.com/).
  - MariaDB 5.5.20 (or greater) (https://mariadb.org/). MariaDB is a fully
    compatible drop-in replacement for MySQL.    

For more detailed information about Drupal requirements, including a list of
PHP extensions and configurations that are required, see "System requirements"
(https://www.drupal.org/requirements) in the Drupal.org online documentation.

For detailed information on how to configure a test server environment using a
variety of operating systems and web servers, see "Local server setup"
(https://www.drupal.org/node/157602) in the Drupal.org online documentation.

Note that all directories mentioned in this document are always relative to the
directory of your Drupal installation, and commands are meant to be run from
this directory (except for the initial commands that create that directory).

OPTIONAL SERVER REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------

- If you plan to use terminal based export then please enable mysqldump command 
  for exporting database.

- Currently, this module is compatible on LAMP.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download and extract allinone_backup.

You can obtain the latest allinone_backup release from https://www.drupal.org.
The files are available in .tar.gz and .zip formats and can be extracted using
most compression tools.

To download and extract the files, on a typical Unix/Linux command line, use
the following commands (assuming you want version x.y.z of Drupal in .tar.gz
format):

  wget https://www.drupal.org/files/projects/allinone_backup-x.y.z.tar.gz
  tar -zxvf allinone_backup-x.y.z.tar.gz

This will create a new directory allinone_backup-x.y.z/ containing all module
files and directories. Then, to move the contents of that directory into a
   /path/to/site/modules directory.

After that, please click on Extends link and search for "All In One Backup" 
for installation and uninstallation of the module.
