The Drupal 8 heir to the addressfield module, powered by the [commerceguys/addressing](https://github.com/commerceguys/addressing) library.

Installation
-------------
This module needs to be installed via Composer, which will download the required libraries.

1. Add the Drupal Packagist repository

    ```sh
    composer config repositories.drupal composer https://packages.drupal.org/8
    ```
This allows Composer to find Address and the other Drupal modules.

2. Download Address

   ```sh
   composer require "drupal/address ~1.0"
   ```
This will download the latest release of Address.
Use 1.x-dev instead of ~1.0 to get the -dev release instead.
