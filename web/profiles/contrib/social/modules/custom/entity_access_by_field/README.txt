Entity Access By Field
==========
Enables site-builders to create custom view permissions for entities
based on field values in the entity_access field.

This module provides:

 - A field type: "entity_access" (based on the radio buttons plugin)
 - Permissions for entity view based on the allowed values of the field type
 - Only support for node entities for now.
